This notifier uses [Slack Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) to send notifications to your Slack workspace.

This notifier runs as a container via Google Cloud Function and responds to events that Cloud Build publishes via its [Pub/Sub topic](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/send-build-notifications).
